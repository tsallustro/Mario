Sprint Number: 2

Name of file being reviewed: CollisionHandler.cs

Comments on Code Quality:
	This class handles the detection of any of the game objects that exist on the current level. Although the code is
	deeply nested, the various checks and loops are necessary in this implementation. The main flaw of this file is the
	block of commented-out conditionals. These were intended to improve the performance of collision detection by only
	checking objects that were near each other, but it ended up breaking left/right collisions. The commenting-out of this
	also leaves some assigned variables that are not used. However, the code performs good enough for the current sprint
	and is pretty easy to understand and modify.

Minutes Taken to Review: 20 minutes

Hypothetical Change:
	A hypothetical change to the game that would impact this file is the addition of many more objects in a single level.
	This file currently checks every moving object with every object on the level. That is, if we have n moving objects,
	it does n^2 checks. So, the addition of more objects will dramatically decrease performance. Although we have a basic
	idea of how to decrease the number of checks, the current implementation does not work and we don't know for sure if
	it will effectively improve performance if it did. We will have to spend more time figuring out how to only check for
	collisions for objects that are nearby.
