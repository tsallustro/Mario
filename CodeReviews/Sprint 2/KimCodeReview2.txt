File being Reviewed: CollisionHandler.cs

Author of the file: Maxwell Ortwig

Code Quality: Overall, CollisionHandler.cs helps to clean up the clutters in Game Object classes. It's taking objects that are moving and observe
	their collision with the objects that are within certain range of the original object instead of checking it with every object in the game.
	But when there are more than one objects moving, it does check the collision between two objects twice. This could slightly slow down the game
	in the future when there are a lot more moving objects within the game. Also, the methods that actually checks the collision are within GameObject
	class, when this class is specifically created to handle any collision related problems.


Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 30

Hypothetical change: There could be more constraints that allow the object to check collision only once every update. Also, other collision method that
	supports the CollisionHandler could also be brought within this class, clearing up more room within GameObject class.
