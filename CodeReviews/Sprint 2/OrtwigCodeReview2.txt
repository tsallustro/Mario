Code Quality:
	The quality of the code is good. The class's main purpose is to hold values that
	are defined for each gameObject and it serves that purpose well. Originally this class
	had methods for detecting collisions, but it was rooted out to make this class more concise. 
	This class works well as with all the changes, we use it's helper methods quite a bit for
	collision regardless of what type of object.

Time Length of Review: 20 minutes

Hypothetical Change:
	In the future, this class could be further split into a gameobjectBlock and gameobjectCharacter
	class. This would separate movement and other types of methods and parameters a bit further and
	may simplify handling of gameObjects later.
