File Reviewed: LevelParser.cs

Author of File Reviewed: Tony Sallustro

Code Quality:
	This code may have high cyclomatic complexity, but it was written well and is easy
	to understand. The parsing of each individual type of object being added to an
	objects list is a smart way to transfer into collision handling of the objects.
	The methods are pretty complex, so it's possible that they could be generalized and
	abstracted, but I don't personally believe it necessary. The file handles IO well,
	preventing possible bugs by throwing exception, and has a good balance between
	"backend" of reading the file with the file structure.

Time Length of Review: 30 minutes

Hypothetical Change: 
	I would hypothetically get the separate parsing functions to return a List<GameObject>
	that would be appended to the total list instead of passing the list into the void
