Comments on Code Quality:
	This Class is very thoughtful and simple. I really like simple! The gist of the code is to section off
	GameObjects into chunks for the program to parse through. In terms of that it does everything very well
	and very straightforward. Chunk also isn't entangled with other classes other than IGameObject.

Minutes Taken to Review: 15 minutes.

Hypothetical Change:
	This wouldn't really serve a purpose for what we've done, but in the future if this code was to be reused,
	it could be used to assign properties to everything in it. For example, if a chunk held a house that you wanted
	to remove for whatever reason, then the entire chunk could be tagged for removal through the chunk.
