Sprint #: 5

File Reviewed: ChunkParser.cs

Author of File Reviewed: Jesse Fowler

Code Quality:
	The code is a development of our original Sprint 1-4 Level Parser
	to include the preloaded level chunks. This class has fundamentally
	high coupling due to the marriage of our level "language" and the
	level of logic interpereted by the code. I suppose that it is necessary
	at some level, but something is off-putting about the arbitrarity of the
	order of parsing. I have no suggestion on how to improve this factor (if
	at all possible), this just gives my gut a feeling that this process
	can be optimized in some way that gives more purpose to the order of
	level loading. The introduction of the chunks follows the similar
	conventions of our level language as before. As said in the file,
	the 4-level deep for loop within the file could for sure be cleaned
	up to tighten up the file.

Time Length of Review: 20 min

Hypothetical Change:
	The change I would make would for sure to be improve the logic around
	line 224 to match chunks. It's possible that a data structure would
	improve chunk matching organization.
