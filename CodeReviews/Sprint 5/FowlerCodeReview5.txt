Comments on Code Quality:
	This class is really well written and easy to understand. It's a singleton, which
	makes sense since only one beam may exist at a time. The velocity is easy to adjust
	and the other class variables are only what is needed and nothing extraneous. The only
	change that I would make to this class is to assign 3 to a variable "numberOfSpritesOnSheet"
	like in other GameObjects, just to get rid of the magic number and make it easier to change
	if the spritesheet is updated. All of the methods do exactly what one would expect and
	nothing else, so it's easy to modify.

Minutes Taken to Review: 20 minutes.

Hypothetical Change:
	A hypothetical change to the game might be allowing the collection of multiple Beams, so
	they essentially stack on top of each other. Since this class is a singleton, it wouldn't
	support this change very well. However, it wouldn't be difficult nor time consuming to make 
	it a normal class instead. The other changes required to support this gameplay change would
	likely need to be made in other classes. If this change was made, it would likely be possible 
	to remove the ResetObject() method since there would be multiple Beams and each one would
	only be used once.
