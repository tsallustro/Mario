File being Reviewed: BossBeam.cs

Author of the file: Tony Sallustro

Code Quality: The code looks simple and clean. But it lacks the description of what each method and functions
	do. It's hard to understand what's going without having to read each method and determine what they do.
	There's also one method that doesn't do anything: Damage(). 

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 20

Hypothetical change: It could have more desciption of each methods, so we don't have to read the entire code in
	order to know what it does. This is actually needed in most of our codes. Damage() is not a problem for only
	this file, but for several others. Damage() is an abstract method from GameObject, which in fact is not being
	used in several objects, thus only taking place in the code. We probably need to add this method to abstract
	classes/interface that actually use this method such as IEnemy and IBoss instead of including IGameObject which
	includes a lot of objects that don't use the method.
