File being Reviewed: Missile.cs

Code Quality: Overall pretty simple. Not a lot to say about this one, mostly general "housekeeping" stuff.
 
-The explicit definition of the GetActve method. Not really a big deal, but I don't understand why it isn't defined with the variable itself (perhaps make the get method 
	public), such as "public Boolean left {get; private set;}". 
-The sender variable: this is sort of beyond the scope of the Missile class, but were Bowser a singleton the sender field would be unnecessary. 
-A reference to the MissileSpriteFactory is saved as a private field despite MissileSpriteFactory being a singleton; not sure why.
-All the ResetObject method does is call IGameObject's SetQueuedForDeletion method. Why not just call that?
-The CheckAndHandleIfAtScreenBoundary method seems like it is too low-level, and the magic numbers 800 and 400 are even commented as the DEFAULT screen size. For
	maintainability, these numbers should be grabbed directly from the GraphicsDevice or Camera. However, the whole
	method could be simplified (see below).

Hypothetical change: The change I would make is to the CheckAndHandleIfAtScreenBoundary method. Instead of doing so many checks directly, it would be a lot easier to
	use the camera field's Limits Rectangle, and check if the rectangle contains the missile's current position. It would make it a lot easier to not only read,
	but to maintain too, since that eliminates the need for the Missile class to know the screen size (default or otherwise) at all, since the Camera class is bound
	to the Viewport.
