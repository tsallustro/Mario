File being Reviewed: Mario.cs

Authorof the file: Jesse Fowler

Code Quality: 
		Mario Class is clean and well-organize. It has all the classes necessary to implement mario as an object and
		well-defined methods that calls for classes needed to update the mario states. Getting and setting of Mario states
		is simple and well-defined; however, it is limited when describing the object's action. There are no methods to
		describe Mario's action (not actionstate) and it is difficult to make even a simple movement of an object if it has
		be temporal. 

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 20

Hypothetical change: 
		We could try adding more methods that could help us define object's movement better. IT is possible to work with 
		the current methods such as MoveLeft() and Up() to define the objects movement (changing of sprite's locations
		thoroughout gametime or interaction with other objects in the game) instead of simply defining the state of Mario.
