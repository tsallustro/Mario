Name of file being reviewed: BlockStates.cs

Author of file being reviewed: Michael Lavelle

Comments on Code Quality:
		This class is straightforward. It is a series of state classes for each possible
		Block state. Each class extends IBlockState and implements the Bump() method.
		There is definitely some repeated code. Every class has its own IBlock variable and
		every class has a constructor that sets this variable. This could be remedied by
		implementing a base abstract BlockState class. This would allow us to only define the
		IBlock variable a single time and simply call the base constructor in any concrete
		block state class.

Minutes Taken to Review: 15 minutes

Hypothetical Change:
		As the class is now, implementing new block states takes more effort than it would if
		there was an abstract BlockState class that each concrete class extended. There is
		definitely a chance that we will need to implement more block states as the game progresses,
		including transitional states between two block states. If we implement the abstract
		base class, it will minimize the amount of code we have to write when adding new block states.
