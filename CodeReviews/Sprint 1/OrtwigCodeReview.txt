Sprint Number: 1

Name of file being reviewed: KeyboardController.cs

Author of file being reviewed: Jesse Fowler

Comments on Code Quality:
	The code quality is clean. There are imports that aren't being used, such as System.Linq, System.Text, etc.
	Everything else in the file is very neat organized and to the point. There is no fluff in the file.
	The code does lack comments that would help someone unfamiliar to navigate what each step does.


Minutes Taken to Review: 15 min

Hypothetical Change:
	I can see nothing that could be changed here that would have any effect on the rest of the project.
	Here's an idea though, in the past, i've played with something called sourcemod. In sourcemod, commands
	carried with them the sender and target objects. This could be something worth implementing, as already
	the lack of context in some situations has caused the code to spaggetti a little bit. To change this, the
	commands that KeyboardController adds to its dictionary would have to be changed.
