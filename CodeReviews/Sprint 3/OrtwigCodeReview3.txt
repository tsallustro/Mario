Code Quality:
	 The code itself is very identical to the other IEnemy objects that exist. With that, I believe 
	 has the same clutteryness that comes from all the behaviors that are needed for collisions and
	 updates. There is some repeat in how damage() just calls stomped() and some cases for collision 
	 are the same, but all the code is concise enough that i dont see any extrenious choices.

Time Length of Review: 20 minutes

Hypothetical Change:
	In the future, this class could become a child of KoopaTroopa due to their simularities. This could
	result in a smaller file size, not having to change things in two places, and shorter code to detect
	what kind of object collidees are.
