Sprint #: 3

File Reviewed: WarpPipe.cs

Author of File Reviewed: Tony Sallustro

Code Quality:
	WarpPipe.cs is a nice and simple implementation of GameObject with a lot of
	"do nothing" default behavior. The most important portion comes from the
	AABB box set in the constructor. The code does rely a good bit on position
	and velocity for the creation in the constructor, but that is just necessary
	for the creation of the object.

Time Length of Review: 15 minutes

Hypothetical Change:
	I would remove the comments from the file and reformat all of the empty
	functions to be single lines. There is not much to improve in this file, but
	the format that it takes is incredibly important for level generation, so it
	is vital that the format the file takes is clean. I would suggest possibly
	reformatting the entire GameObject or creating a child more suited for
	stationary objects in world generation. Overall, this file is good!!
