Comments on Code Quality:
	This class is quite straightforward and follows the pattern of the other GameObjects. The code
	is about as minimal and easy to understand as possible. Each method does what one would expect it
	to do, and there is not really any extra fluff or inefficiencies. However, it doesn't seem like the
	2 fireball limit is enforced inside FireBall, and is enforced in LevelParser instead. While this
	is understandable since the limit is more relevant to the level/game, it's probably less clear than
	if it was enforced inside FireBall. Finally, the physics and movement constants are hard-coded and not
	contained inside private readonly constants. It would be easier to tweak the behavior if these are easier
	to find and change.

Minutes Taken to Review: 20 minutes

Hypothetical Change:
	One hypothetical change that was hinted at in my previous comments is the changing of the number of
	FireBalls allowed on screen. This change would not be made in FireBall, but would have to be made in
	LevelParser. However, FireBall seems to be able to handle any change in this limit without modifications.
	Another hypothetical change is modifying the physics of FireBalls so they can be launched further/not as 
	far or faster, etc. As mentioned before, the physics constants are hard-coded inside methods so they aren't
	really easy to access. It would be easy to miss changing a constant or two when making a future change, so
	the current implementation could not handle physics modifications as well as it could.
