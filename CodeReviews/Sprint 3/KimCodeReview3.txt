File being Reviewed: Mario.cs

Code Quality: Just to let you know, I'm reviewing parts that were added to the original code. The code is
	getting messier and messier. Without being able to separate the part of code that does one thing, we
	are continuously adding on to the original code to add more functionality to Mario as an Object. I see
	that some physics were added to not only the update function, but it also reference to method that handles 
	collision. It feels like code is reaching out to all over the place, but we know that if we don't do it
	this way, it doesn't work because Mario update is currently ordered so if we tried to put the functionality 
	to a place that makes more sense to check, it simply won't work. 


Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 20

Hypothetical change: We could possibly create a new class called Physics where we can put all the functionality
	that works with the physics in the game to that class. Instead of putting it in a Mario.update() where it
	has to extend out to different classes and methods to figure out whether gravity should apply or not, we
	should separate such method/class, so that the code is kept clean and easier to manage.
