Code Quality: This code is great! It has an extremely low dependency on other
	parts of code in this project, actually i dont think it has ANY! The code 
	is also open to be expanded upon in the future, as its not restricting in 
	any way and it's easy to add new sound effects.

Hypothetical Change: Something that can be changed is give the ability to 
	change the mapsound. This could be used in case there was a need to change 
	the music without changing the map
