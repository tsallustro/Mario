Code Quality:
	The code is a nice abstraction to handle sound in the Mario Game. It
	covers all of the necessary bases without any complicated logic.
	The methods are all simple, and are good at the one thing that they
	do. The mapping of sounds into a dictionary is a genious way to couple
	sound effects. The "data management" within this class is overall very
	efficient and keeps the class clean. The only thing in this class that
	is the least bit confusing is the control logic in the PlaySound()
	method.

Hypothetical Change:
	If I were to change this file, I would tighten up the the PlaySound()
	method's logic, or otherwise write a short comment clearing up any
	possible confusions. Otherwise, there are some inconsistencies with the
	syntax of the file that should be rectified and consolidated into one
	system.
