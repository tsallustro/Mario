File being Reviewed: Flag.cs

Code Quality: It's simple and clean, but there are some unnecessary methods with no functionality that needs to 
	be cleaned. When playing the game, there was one element of the flag that was missing. Depending on where
	Mario lands on the flag, flag falls down quicker. At the moment, flag falls at the constant rate, which can
	be improved on later date. I mentioned that this class is simple. But maybe it is too simple. Some functionalities
	such as collecting different amount of points based on where Mario lands on the flag are all put into Mario class.
	Since it also involves flag, we could have made them flag class's job to keep track of that not Mario.

Hypothetical change: A simple change is to get rid of the methods that are not being used and bring some work done by
	another class that involves flags. Flag class is simple and does its job. But instead of making another class do
	20 different job, we could bring few of them and let other class do the work. We could also improve it by having
	a method to change the rate of flag falling based on where Mario lands.
