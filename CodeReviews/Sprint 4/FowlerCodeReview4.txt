Comments on Code Quality:
	This class is about as simple as one could expect, but it's still a bit difficult to understand
	due to the nature of the problem the class is solving. I tried to modify it a little to tweak the
	behavior of sound effects but I had a lot of trouble getting things to work properly. The sound effect
	dictionary is smart and makes it easy to add, modify, and remove sound effects. Also, the methods are
	short and the logic itself is easy to understand. I think what's tripping me up is the MediaPlayer class.

Minutes Taken to Review: 15 minutes

Hypothetical Change:
	A hypothetical change we might make in the future is the selective muting of certain sound effects but 
	not others. Currently, I don't think this file would easily support this change. The PlaySound() method 
	is called in many different classes, so this could be done individually in each separate file when needed.
	To better support this hypothetical change, a second dictionary could be created mapping each GameSound to
	a boolean value that determines whether a GameSound is muted or not.
